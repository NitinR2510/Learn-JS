# Learn-JS
I am learning JS during the 2020 lockdown due to COVID-19. And I guess I shall mostly have it covered by the end of this month on:
<ul>
 <li> Coursera: Interactivity with JS</li>
 <li> HackerRank: 10 days with JS</li>
 <li>Finally, I have enrolled in the Internet &amp; Web Programming course at my university which shall go till September actually. There is also a project component in that.</li>
 </ul>
 <b>I highly recommend Coursera and Hackkerank, though HackerRank clearly needs way more perseverance and work.</b>
 
 **I'll try to update resources down here**
